> We are the local R user group for the University of Virginia and Charlottesville area. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics (<http://www.r-project.org/>). Our goal is to support and share R experience and knowledge among its users in the UVa community. We would like to hear how you use and enjoy the R language and statistical programming environment.
